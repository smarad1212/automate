Here is a detailed lesson plan for David, a 10-year-old student, to be conducted in Hebrew on a Saturday:

Title: ״הרפתקה מדעית במדבר - יום שבת עם דוד״

Lesson Structure:

1. Reading Passage (15 minutes):
   - Title: "חיים במדבר - איך בעלי חיים מתמודדים עם האתגרים?"
   - The passage will discuss how different desert animals and plants adapt to the harsh conditions of the desert environment, including strategies for finding water, staying cool, and protecting themselves.

2. Hebrew Lesson (20 minutes):
   - Focus on improving David's reading comprehension and vocabulary related to the desert ecosystem.
   - Exercises will include:
     - Answering comprehension questions about the reading passage.
     - Matching Hebrew words to their English equivalents.
     - Creating sentences using new vocabulary words.

3. Math Activity (25 minutes):
   - Title: "חישובי מים במדבר"
   - David will learn how to calculate the amount of water needed by desert animals and plants, based on factors such as size, activity level, and temperature.
   - He will solve word problems involving water consumption and conservation.

4. STEM Project (30 minutes):
   - Title: "בניית רובוט חוקר מדברי"
   - David will design and build a small robotic explorer that can navigate through a simulated desert environment.
   - He will use basic coding principles to program the robot's movements and sensors.
   - The project will encourage David's problem-solving, creativity, and interest in science and technology.

5. Reflection and Summary (10 minutes):
   - David will write a short reflection on what he learned about desert ecosystems and how he can apply this knowledge to help conserve water and protect the environment.
   - The lesson will end with a summary of the key concepts covered during the session.

Weekly Schedule:

This lesson is part of a 4-lesson per week schedule for David. The other lessons may focus on topics such as ancient Greek history, financial literacy, and creative writing.

Adaptations for ADHD:

- Incorporate frequent breaks and changes in activity to maintain David's attention.
- Use visual aids, such as diagrams and interactive simulations, to support his learning.
- Provide immediate feedback and encouragement to keep him engaged.
- Set clear, achievable goals for each section of the lesson.

I hope this lesson plan provides a engaging and educational experience for David! Let me know if you need any modifications or have additional requirements.
